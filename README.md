## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS  
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### Featured Section

  Form input on error display ! and message 

Provided are code samples of areas of highlight.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

I dislike that this width is 101 to fit in with the rest of the form. But I am unsure why it is not the same length as the other inputs set at 100% width.
```css
/* Form Submit */

.submitBtn {
  width: 101%;
  margin-top: 1rem;
  color: var(--lite);
  background-color: var(--mountainMeadow);
  box-shadow: 0 7px 3px 1px rgba(62, 60, 73, .3);
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
